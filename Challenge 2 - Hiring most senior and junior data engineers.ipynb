    "A company has secured a $1 million budget to build a data team and develop its data platform. The hiring team is working with a dataset called “Candidate,” which contains a comprehensive list of potential hires, categorized as senior and junior data engineers, along with details about their salary expectations. All senior and junior candidates have similar skills within their respective levels and are considered eligible for hiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the hiring team is -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To hire the maximum number of seniors first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After hiring the maximum number of seniors, the remaining budget should be used to hire as many juniors as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>You need to write a SQL query to get the optimal list of all the candidates who can join the data team based on the above goals?</b>\n",
